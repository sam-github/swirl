<h3>1.&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p>
This memo documents the architecture of the C BEEPCORE
 libraries. It is intended to be read in conjunction with the Profile
 Tutorial and the <b>doc++</b> documentation.
 Where particular implementation choices are mentioned, they refer to the implementation choices of the current implementation, with generalizations naturally possible.

<h3>2.&nbsp;Glossary</h3>

<blockquote class="text"><dl>

<dt>Profile</dt>
<dd>
 - A specification of the behavior of a particular BEEP
channel.
</dd>

<dt>Profile Implementation</dt>
<dd>
 - A piece of code implementing a
profile's specification. Sometimes simply "profile" where this is not
ambiguous. This is a "concrete class" implementing the profile.
</dd>

<dt>Profile Registration</dt>
<dd>
 - A structure that specifies the entry points and other static information about one profile within a profile implementation. This is similar to an "abstract interface" to a class.
</dd>

<dt>Profile Instance</dt>
<dd>
 - A data structure representing an open
channel. The instance has a reference to its registration and serves as an
"instance" of the profile "class."
</dd>

<dt>Application</dt>
<dd>
 - The top-level code that runs in a process. It is responsible for managing profile registrations and sockets, and assigning sockets and registrations to wrappers. 
</dd>

<dt>Session Structure</dt>
<dd>
 - The low-level session instance as defined by
the core libraries. The session structure represents a single session, from
greeting to close. It tracks open channels and outstanding messages. However,
it does no I/O itself, and it has no concept of "profile" as such. A new
session structure must be created to generate a greeting, so a TLS tuning reset
will create a new session structure.
</dd>

<dt>Wrapper</dt>
<dd>
 - The wrapper is the code that provides I/O services for
the session and interfaces to profile instances. It is responsible for
determining which profiles shall run, creating threads for them,
managing the timing requirements of the lower layer libraries, locking
where necessary, logging of important events, and so on.
</dd>

<dt>Wrapper Instance</dt>
<dd>
 - This represents an entire connection, from
the opening of the socket to the closing of the socket. It is a structure 
managed by the wrapper code.

</dd>

<dt>Wrapper Mode</dt>
<dd>
 - Each session within a wrapper is in a particular
mode. A tuning reset can change modes. For example, "plaintext" and "encrypted"
might be two modes. Profiles indicate the modes in which they are active when
they register, and the wrapper ensures that active profiles are properly
managed. Modes are arbitrary short strings.
</dd>

<dt>Request, Indication, Response, Confirmation</dt>
<dd>
 - These four terms
(from the OSI reference model) name the four messages which cross the API
boundaries in a client-server model. The request is the initial message sent.
When it arrives at the peer, it is an indication. The peer's answer is formed
as a response. When the response is delivered, it is a confirmation. Note that
confirmations can be negative or positive; both &lt;error&gt; and &lt;ok&gt;
can be confirmations.
</dd>

<h3>3.&nbsp;Concepts</h3>

<p>
 There are a number of concepts that are used throughout this document.
Understanding these concepts is vital to understanding the document and the
libraries. 
Although the RFCs include many of these concepts,
the libraries have implementation-specific meanings for them.
These concepts are described herein. 
</p>

<blockquote class="text"><dl>

<dt>Frame vs. Message</dt>
<dd>
 - The first distinction is between a frame and
a message. While both are clearly defined in the RFCs, the libraries deal only
with frames. A frame that happens to hold both the beginning of a message and
the end of a message is a complete message as well as a complete frame. Many
places in the API accept a "frame," such as the routine to send a frame over a
channel. It should be understood that if one wants to send a complete message,
the complete message is put into a frame and one sends the frame. There are
also API calls to determine if enough frames have arrived to form a complete
message and to accept a series of frames and turn them into a single complete
frame. 
</dd>

<dt>Session vs. Wrapper Instance</dt>
<dd>
 - The RFCs are mildly confusing
about what constitutes a session. In some places, a session is described as
being established with a greeting. In other places, the description implies
there is one session per transport connection. These two different
interpretations come into conflict when a tuning reset is performed, which
issues a new greeting over the same transport connection. For the purposes of
this document, a new session starts just before a greeting is issued, and that
session persists until channel zero is closed. Channel zero is closed when either the underlying transport connection is closed or before a non-BEEP negotiation (such as a TLS negotiation) starts,
before another greeting is sent. The session can also be terminated without closing
the underlying socket by a tuning reset understood by both peers but which does
not result in a new BEEP greeting. (For example, a tuning reset after which
some different protocol is used over the socket would fall into this category.)
On the other hand, one wrapper instance corresponds to multiple BEEP sessions.
A wrapper instance is finished when the last BEEP-formatted message has been
exchanged. This occurs when a session is closed, a socket error occurs, a
protocol error occurs, or a tuning reset explicitly destroys the wrapper
without closing the socket (which is an example of the different-protocol
tuning reset described previously). 
</dd>

<dt>Tuning Profile</dt>
<dd>
 - The RFCs describe a tuning profile as one which
configures something about the entire session and then either goes idle or
initiates a tuning reset. In this document, and for purposes of the library, a
tuning profile is one that initiates a tuning reset. There is no practical
reason to distinguish a profile which runs briefly then idles from one which
continues to run. In the sense used in this document, a tuning profile 
monopolizes the connection, preventing other profiles from exchanging
data while it runs. 
</dd>

<dt>Frame-mode vs. Message-mode</dt>
<dd>
 - A profile implementation has two
ways in which it can deal with incoming messages. It has the choice of dealing
with frames as they arrive, or waiting until the remote peer has finished
sending an entire message. This is entirely a matter of implementation choice,
not a matter of protocol. By dealing with individual frames rather than waiting
for entire messages, one can handle arbitrarily large messages and one might
achieve a greater throughput via pipelining of I/O and processing. By dealing
only with complete messages, one might achieve a significant simplification in
message parsing and management. 
</dd>

<dt>Mode</dt>
<dd>
 - Each wrapper instance associates a "mode" with each
session. This mode is represented as an arbitrary string. It is simply a
selection mechanism for deciding which of the configured profile
implementations will be initialized and/or advertised in the greeting of that
particular session. The initial mode is specified when the wrapper instance is
created. A profile instance that initiates a tuning reset can specify the mode
of the new session after the tuning reset completes and before the new greeting
(if any) is sent. 
</dd>

<dt>Initiator vs. Listener Wrapper Instances</dt>
<dd>
 - In the RFCs, the
initiating session is the one that issues an active open on the underlying
transport connection, while the listening session is the one that issues the
passive open. In socket terms, the initiator calls "connect" while the listener
calls "accept." Since initializing a wrapper involves passing in an
already-connected socket, one must also pass in whether this is a listener or
initiator wrapper. The application is responsible for opening the socket, so
the wrapper itself cannot deduce this. Indeed, it might be different for two
different sockets (and thus wrapper instances) within the same application. At
the protocol level, the only real difference is the set of channel numbers that
may appear within the &lt;start&gt; element. 
</dd>

<dt>Initiator vs. Listener Profile Implementations</dt>
<dd>
 - On the other
hand, the "initiator" and "listener" terms also apply to profile
implementations. In this case, a "listener" profile is one whose URI is
advertised in the greeting. An "initiator" profile is one that is initialized
but is not advertised in the greeting. Either type of profile may accept
&lt;start&gt; requests, and either type may initiate &lt;start&gt; requests.
However, since a profile must be initialized before a channel can be started
for that profile, a profile listed in a &lt;start&gt; request must be either an
initiator or listener profile for the current mode. 
</dd>

<dt>Profile Registration</dt>
<dd>
 - In the RFCs, a profile registration is a
mechanism for reserving and advertising profiles via the IANA. In the context
of the wrappers, a profile registration is a structure listing the URI and
entry points (along with a few other items), informing the wrapper of which
functions to invoke upon the occurrence of certain events.

<h3>4.&nbsp;The Parts</h3>

<p>
 The library is broken into a number of layers. There are four major parts
of any C-BEEPCORE based application that intercommunicate to form a server or
client. A brief (and imprecise) description of each follows: 
</p>

<blockquote class="text"><dl>

<dt>Core Library</dt>
<dd>
 - The core library is written in pure portable C.
It invokes no operating system services on its own. It does no memory
allocation or I/O on its own. It is responsible for parsing incoming frames,
formatting outgoing frames, tracking open channels, generating and responding
to SEQ frames, and in general all the stuff that every RFC3080 and RFC3081
implementation will need to do. It is not expected that the authors of profiles
will use the core library directly. Instead, they will always use a wrapper.

</dd>

<dt>Wrapper</dt>
<dd>
 - The wrapper is a piece of code that "wraps around" the
core library. It provides for synchronization, I/O, memory allocation, mapping
of URIs in &lt;start&gt; requests to code in the application, thread
management, and so on. All access by profile implementations to the BEEP
functionality will be via a wrapper. 
</dd>

<dt>Profile Implementations</dt>
<dd>
 - The "meat and potatos" of the system
is of course the profile implementations. Profile implementations are pieces of
code that implement profiles. They are registered with a wrapper and invoked by
the application and the wrapper. They are responsible for generating and
responding to individual messages over channels. 
</dd>

<dt>Application</dt>
<dd>
 - Finally, the application that puts it all
together. The application is responsible for parsing any configuration files,
creating sockets, loading any dynamically-loaded profile implementations,
registering profile implementations with wrappers, and starting the wrapper.
It's also responsible for cleaning up after the wrapper has finished its work,
closing sockets and so on. 
</dd>

</dl></blockquote>
<p>

<p>
 It is important to note that profiles and applications access only the
wrapper code, and the wrapper code regulates all access to the core code. 
</p>

<p>
 Of course, there is the difference between code and process, which is
glossed over here. That is, while there is likely only one wrapper (i.e., one
piece of code), there may be many wrapper instances active at once, each
serving a particular socket. While there is likely only one implementation of
each profile, there will be one instantiation of each profile for each channel
running that profile. A single application might be running in multiple
processes. And finally, the core library can create session structures to track
various BEEP sessions in a single process.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><font face="verdana, helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">

<p>
 The reason for splitting the profile implementations off as separate chunks
of code should be pretty obvious. The design of the BEEP protocol is to allow
exactly this sort of thing. Splitting the profile code from the rest of the
code allows for new profiles to be developed after the library has been
finished. 
</p>

<p>
 The reason for separating the wrapper from the application is to avoid
making decisions in the wrapper about finding profile implementations,
configuration, and so on. It also allows the wrapper to be used for both
initiators and listeners without change. If Invisible Worlds supplied the
main() routine, the configuration would be so complex as to be unmanagable.
Instead, the developer of an application is responsible for configuration. The
developer is also responsible when coding initiators for starting the
appropriate channels with the appropriate start data. The application also decides whether to run one session per process or multiple sessions per process. 
</p>

<p>
 Finally, the reason for separating the core library from the wrapper is to
allow the core library to be reused in places where the wrapper might not be
portable. For example, the core library could be used as part of an Apache
module, embedded in a BEEP-enabled PDA, or used in a test and performance
harness. Each of these applications would require a new wrapper, but all could
use the same core library. In addition, a new wrapper is likely necessary for
various operating systems, while the same core library will serve all operating
systems, including those without threads. 
</p>

<p>
 As can be seen above, the application is naturally the outermost structure.
It is responsible for creating the socket, loading the profile implementations,
instantiating a wrapper, and registering the profile implementations with the
wrapper. It manages the creation and destruction of sockets and wrappers. In an initiating application, it is also responsible for starting the channels once greetings are exchanged.

<h3>6.&nbsp;Design Decisions</h3>

<p>
 The most obvious design decision was the overall architecture of the system, as described previously: the separation of wrapper from core, and of application from wrapper. 
</p>

<h4><a name="anchor6">6.1</a>&nbsp;The Core Library</h4>

<p>
 The core library (CBEEP.c) was designed with a number of goals in mind.  It
does not rely on any operating system services except where absolutely
necessary. In particular, it does not rely on threads, I/O, or memory
allocation. All these services are provided by the wrapper. While it uses a few
routines from string.h and such, in theory the core library could be written
entirely in C with no other libraries or OS services linked in. 
</p>

<p>
 The core is not "active". The only time the library does anything is when
the wrapper calls it. For example, all parsing of frame headers takes place as
the wrapper copies the bytes into the library. All management of internal
channel structures occurs when the wrapper asks to dequeue a frame from channel
zero. The selection of which frame to send next and the generation of SEQ
messages occurs when the wrapper asks if any bytes are available to be written
to the socket. Notifications are issued as part of dealing with other calls.
For example, notifying the wrapper that a full frame has arrived is handled
during the call that gives the bytes from the socket to the library.  
</p>

<p>
 In addition, the core library does not deal with profiles at all. It deals
with channels and URIs, but the actual concept of a "profile" as such is not
necessary. Hence, it is the wrapper's responsibility to map channels and URIs
to profiles. 
</p>

<p>
 The core library itself is only serially reentrant for any given session
instance. That is, if one thread is running within one of the blu_* or bll_*
routines, no other thread should enter any of those routines passing a
reference to the same session. On the other hand, since all global data is
stored in session structures, multiple sessions can be in progress at the same
time in a reentrant way. 
</p>

<p>
 The core library is designed with efficiency in mind. Frames are expected
to be read from the socket directly into the memory that is passed to the
profile, and written directly from the memory the profile fills in. 
</p>

<p>
 Internally, the core library stores all state information in a session
structure or a structure pointed to therefrom. There are a few input and output
buffers allocatated to the session (head_buf, read_buf, seq_buf), and each
session maintains a pointer to a frame being read (read_frame). It also holds
the greeting from the other peer. Finally, each session structure points to a
table of channel structures, one for each open channel (including channel
zero), currently organized as a linked list sorted by priority. Of course,
general session state is maintained also. 
</p>

<p>
 Each channel, in turn, holds an ordered list of incoming frames, an ordered
list of outgoing frames, a "committed" frame which is the next to be sent or in
the process of being sent on this channel, an ordered list of received messages
that have not been fully answered, and an ordered list of sent messages that
have not been fully answered. The channel structure also holds all the other
state necessary to make things work. 
</p>

<h4><a name="anchor7">6.1.1</a>&nbsp;Protocol Enforcement</h4>

<p>
 The core library enforces many aspects of the BEEP protocol. It refuses to
accept frames beyond the valid sequence range. It refuses to send frames out of
order. It refuses to send a reply to a message number that has not been
received. Etc. However, there is one condition that is not enforced by the core
library. In particular, if a close request for a channel is queued on channel
zero, it is possible that request will be sent over the socket before all the
messages already queued for the channel being closed have been sent. It is up
to the wrapper to prevent this by delaying the close request until the channel
is quiescent. 
</p>

<h4><a name="anchor8">6.1.2</a>&nbsp;Memory Management</h4>

<p>
 As part of the design of the core library, memory usage can be limited.
When instantiating a wrapper or a session, a pointer to a malloc-like function
and a free-like function is provided by the application. However, it is not the
intent that these be used to limit memory usage, particularly since there is no
convenient way of telling which wrapper or session is allocating the memory.
Instead, the per-channel and per-wrapper limits should be set. 
</p>

<p>
 The per-channel memory limit is the "receive window." Peers are not
permitted to send more payload than will fit in the window at one time. After
frames that have been received have been passed to bpc_frame_destroy, a SEQ is
sent to allow the peer to send more. This limit keeps the peer from filling up
local memory if the local profile stops reading the channel for any reason.

</p>

<p>
 The per-wrapper limit is a single limit for all frame allocations made with
bpc_buffer_allocate or bpc_frame_aggregate. It is an arbitrary limit, enforced
only if set. It is essentially the sender side of the receive window limit. It
prevents the local machine from filling up all of memory if the remote peer
stops reading the channel for any reason. 
</p>

<h4><a name="anchor9">6.2</a>&nbsp;The Wrapper Library</h4>

<p>
 In contrast to the core library, the wrapper library is designed to be very
active and asynchronous. It mediates between the core library and the rest of
the application and profiles. It starts multiple threads when multiple channels
are open. It invokes callbacks on profiles, and expects the profiles to answer
these callbacks. 
</p>

<p>
 Other wrappers might take an entirely different approach to threading and
timing and configuration. For example, a wrapper designed to be used as an
Apache module might use the Apache interface to threading and configuration.
We do not discuss these possiblities further here. 
</p>

<p>
 In general, a profile is described by a profile registration structure.
That structure describes when the profile implementation should be active and
how the wrapper should invoke the profile implementation. The functions that
the wrapper calls all start with "pro_" for "profile." The functions that the
profile invokes start with "bp_" or "bpc_",
for "BEEP library wrapper" or "BEEP library wrapper, channel-specific",
respectively.
</p>

<p>
 The library uses some OSI reference model terminology. In particular, it
uses the terms "request", "indication", "response", and "confirmation" in a
precise way.  Generally, either an application or a profile will invoke a
request, such as a request to start a channel. The peer will receive this
request as an indication, and reply with a response. The originator of the
request will receive the answer as a confirmation. Hence, all b*_ functions
that cause protocol actions cause requests or responses. Also, all pro_
functions that cause protocol actions are indications or confirmations.
</p>

<p>
 Technically, the pro_ functions implemented by the profile are intended to
return immediately without blocking. However, there is an extra threading layer
provided by the wrapper, so with the appropriate set-up, profile
implementations don't need to worry about blocking. They still must, however,
ensure that every indication is answered with a response, for example. 
</p>

<p>
 The wrapper is designed to allow a profile to easily interact with its
peer. Interacting with multiple peers requires multiple profile instances and
more sophisticated programming technique to link them together. For example, a
profile implementing a multi-user game would need to implement some sort of
shared data structure to allow the profile instance associated with each player
to affect the other profile instances on other wrappers. That is, each "player"
could easily affect the "world," but the application would have to arrange for
the changes to the "world" to be distributed back out to all "players." 
</p>

<h4><a name="anchor10">6.3</a>&nbsp;The Application Layer</h4>

<p>
 Each application will have its own application layer. A couple of simple
application layers are provided, but more complex applications need to be coded
to cooperate with the profiles they support. 
</p>

<p>
 The application is responsible for loading configuration, loading profiles,
creating a connected socket (via connect or accept), instantiating a wrapper
for that socket, and cleaning up when the wrapper is finished. An initiating
application is also responsible for starting any required channels, while a
listening application can usually rely on the initiator to trigger any actions
it needs to take. 
</p>

<p>
 The applications that come with the wrapper and core libraries follow a simple operation: 
</p>

<ul class="text">

<li>
Typically a configuration file is read that specifies:

<ul class="text">

<li>
Profiles that are dynamically-loaded.
</li>

<li>
Transport information such as server name and port number.
</li>

</ul>
<p>

</li>

<li>
They call a library routine that loads the profiles and invokes
the _init entry point of each profile so loaded,
building a list of all registrations returned thereby. 
</li>

<li>
The listener mode sets up a listening socket and accepts
connections;
in contrast,
the initiator mode attempts to connect to the server at the port provided. 
</li>

<li>
Once the connection is established, the listener forks and instantiates a
wrapper in the "plaintext" mode;
in contrast,
the initiator does not fork,
but simply instantiates a wrapper in the "plaintext" mode. 
</li>

<li>
Within the application layer that comes with the library, individual
initiating profiles are responsible for establishing connections. 
Typically,
each profile will expose additional entry points
(other than _init)
for this purpose.
</li>

</ul>
<p>

<p>
 The code for a very simple forking server (listener) might look like this: 
</p>
</font><pre>
  Read configuration file
  Load configured profile implementations
  Create a listening socket
  loop:
    Accept a connection
    Fork
    if child:
      Instantiate a wrapper
      Register all the profiles
      Start the wrapper
      Wait for the wrapper to complete
      Check and handle the wrapper status
      Destroy the wrapper
      Close the socket
      Exit
</pre><font face="verdana, helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">

Note:

- VortexOnCloseChannel ... must return true/false, so is not so useful if you have
to post it's result to a new thread.

Can it NOT return? Will that block other threads?

- vortex_connection_new() returns NULL if on_connected is provided - not documented.

What is focus?

GUI?

Qt demo of Vortex? Qt understanding of Tcp?

lua chat server?

Maybe best to work towards a goal --> What does a chat application need?

- not like IM, make it like IRC, so everything goes to everybody

Get single-channel working, but where you choose the server, save the server
prefs, save whether it should auto-connect, save window settings, save chat history.


--> demos Qt ability

- Strip the tcp echo out.

Next, get single-channel working with lua threaded server.

x qchat client of 'echo' service

- cchatd server of beep chat service
    ... this is the vortex echo-server, except instead of sending data in
    reply, it should send it with MSG, and wait for RPY.

- chat (cmdline) client of beep chat service
    ... should reimplement in a non-blocking way. I'll need this
    to play with the client

- qchat client of beep chat service

- lchatd (lua chat server) with beep

- lechod (lua echo server) with luasocket
